\textbf{Abstract:} Hippotherapy is one of the highly effective treatment methods for Cerebral Palsy (CP) rehabilitation by using horse riding activity, which is beneficial to the patient because the stimuli: horse gait which is very similar to mechanical gait in humans and also visual input from the environment. However, the need of large area, quiet environment, and high maintenance costs of the facilities lead to expensive treatment. To solve this problem, we use a store-bought horse riding simulator device, and also give visual input through a simple game and an immersive virtual environment. The device then can be put in a room in a hospital for the patient's therapy. A therapy in hospital is covered by the Indonesian healthcare, thus affordable an beneficial, especially for children with CP families with low-income socioeconomic condition. This article provides the design of the system, block diagrams, game design, build instructions, and software codes needed for building the device.
